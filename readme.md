# MySQL Shell Plugins

The MySQL Shell Plugins Repository is a collection of plugins for the MySQL Shell (part of MySQL Server), written by the MySQL Client Tools team. It covers currently these plugins:

- **GUI plugin**: provides backend functionality for the [MySQL Shell GUI](gui/frontend/readme.md) application.
- **MDS plugin**: implements [MySQL Database Services](mds_plugin/readme.md) and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure support
- **MRS plugin**: implements [MySQL REST Service](mrs_plugin/readme.md) support

The GUI plugin backend and the two other plugins can all be used on their own via MySQL Shell, but together they power the [MySQL Shell GUI](gui/frontend/readme.md) and the [MySQL Shell for VS Code](gui/extension/readme.md). Read the individual project readme files for more details, how to contribute and other information.
