# MRS Dialog Reference

This section discusses the individual MRS UI dialogs offered by MySQL Shell for VS Code.

## MRS Service Dialog

### REST Service Properties

Each REST service has a common set of properties.

| Option | Description |
| --- | ----- |
| MRS Service Path | The URL context root of this service |
| Comments | Comments to describe this service |
| Host Name | If specified, only requests for this host are served |
| Supported Protocols | The supported protocols (HTTPS by default) |
| Enabled | Specifies if the service is served by MySQL Router |
| Options | Advanced options in JSON format |

### REST Service Advanced Options

The following advanced options can be set in JSON format:

- headers: Accepts a JSON object with one or more HTTP header names as key and its setting as value.
- http:
  - allowedOrigin: If set to `auto`, MySQL Router dynamically sets the header `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` to the domain generating the request. Alternatively, this can be set to a specific domain `https://mydomain.com` or a list of domains (for example, `["https://mydomain.com", "https://myotherdomain.com"]`).
- logging:
  - exceptions: If set to `true`, exceptions are logged.
  - requests:
    - body: If set to `true`, the full body of all requests are logged.
    - headers: If set to `true,` only the headers of all requests are logged.
  - response:
    - body: If set to `true`, the full body of all responses are logged.
    - headers: If set to `true`, only the headers of all responses are logged.
  - returnInternalErrorDetails: If set to `true`, the cause errors with code 500 are sent to the client.
  - includeLinksInResults: If set to `false``, the results do not include navigation links.

#### Default REST Service Options

The example that follows shows the options that are used as default when deploying a new service.

Note: These options are only recommended for development and must be changed for use in production.

By setting `allowedOrigin` to `auto` MySQL Router dynamically sets the header `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` to the domain that generates the request. This is done to work around Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) checks of web browsers during development time.

```json
{
    "headers": {
        "Access-Control-Allow-Credentials": "true",
        "Access-Control-Allow-Headers": "Content-Type, Authorization, X-Requested-With, Origin, X-Auth-Token",
        "Access-Control-Allow-Methods": "GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS"
    },
    "http": {
        "allowedOrigin": "auto"
    },
    "logging": {
        "exceptions": true,
        "request": {
            "body": true,
            "headers": true
        },
        "response": {
            "body": true,
            "headers": true
        }
    },
    "returnInternalErrorDetails": true
}
```

When deploying a REST service in production, the following settings need to be changed:

1. Change `allowedOrigin` to the domain, or domains, the REST service is running on (for example,  `"https://mydomain.com"` when deploying on a production server).
2. Set `returnInternalErrorDetails` to `false`.
3. Adjust the logging settings as needed.

## MRS Schema Dialog

### REST Schema Properties

Each REST schema has a common set of properties.

| Option | Description |
| --- | ----- |
| MRS Service Path | The path of the REST service for this REST schema |
| Comments | Comments to describe this MRS schema |
| REST Schema Path | The request path to access the schema (must start with /) |
| Schema Name | The name of the corresponding database schema |
| Items per Page | The default number of items to be returned when requesting REST objects of this schema |
| Enabled | Whether or not the REST objects of this REST schema are exposed through the REST interface |
| Requires Authentication | Whether or not authentication is required to access the REST objects of this REST schema |
| Options | Additional options in JSON format |

## MRS Object Dialog

The following aspects can be set through the dialog.

- Basic Settings
  - The database schema object that should be exposed via MRS
  - The URL path of how to access the REST object
- Security
  - Whether the object is publicly available or requires authentication
  - The CRUD operations that are allowed
  - The CRUD operations that are allowed on referenced tables
  - Whether row ownership should be enforced to enable row level security
- JSON/Relation Duality
  - Which columns of the database schema object should be exposed and how they should be named
  - Which referenced tables should be included, either nested or unnested or reduced to a single field
