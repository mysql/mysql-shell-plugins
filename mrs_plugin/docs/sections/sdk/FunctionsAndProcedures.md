# Functions and Procedures

In its most basic form, a REST Function or Procedure can be executed with the MRS SDK using the `call()` command. The command must receive, as input, the SET of `IN` and/or `INOUT` parameters (and corresponding values) allowed by the database routine.

Consider the following REST Function based on the `inventory_in_stock` function available in the [Sakila Sample Database](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/).

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE REST FUNCTION /inventoryInStock
    ON SERVICE /myService SCHEMA /sakila
    AS sakila.inventory_in_stock
    PARAMETERS MyServiceSakilaInventoryInStockParams {
        pInventoryId: p_inventory_id @IN
    }
    RESULT MyServiceSakilaInventoryInStockResult {
        result: result @DATATYPE("bit(1)")
    }
    AUTHENTICATION NOT REQUIRED;
```

In the TypeScript SDK, the command accepts, as its first parameter, an object containing the set of `IN` and/or `INOUT` parameters (and corresponding values).

```TypeScript
myService.sakila.inventoryInStock.call({ pInventoryId: 1 });
// true
```

In the Python SDK, the command accepts the same set of parameters and values as keyword arguments:

```py
my_service.sakila.inventory_in_stock.call(p_inventory_id=1)
# true
```

## Async Task Support

Long-running REST Functions/Procedures can use the MySQL Async Task framework to spawn a monitoring task which can be asynchronously checked for updates by the client, in order to avoid directly executing the routine and hit any existing HTTP request or MySQL Router handling timeouts.

Using the MRS TypeScript SDK, applications can either manually monitor tasks spawned for a given REST routine, or simply execute the routine without having to worry about those issues.

In this case, for REST routine with an associated Async Task, the SDK will produce the same compatible `call()` command, with support for an additional object that allows to specify a set of execution options, namely:

  - `refreshRate` specifies the interval (ms) between each status update check
  - `progress` specifies an asynchronous callback that is executed with the details of each status update report

As an example, consider the REST Function depicted above has an associated Async Task. Executing the task, whilst obtaining the status update reports generated by that task can be done, in TypeScript, as follows:

```TypeScript
myService.sakila.inventoryInStock.call({ pInventoryId: 1 }, { progress: (r) => console.log(r) });
```

Additionally, the SDK produces a `start()` command, which starts the task and allows to manually watch for status updates and/or kill the task (cancelling the execution of the actual routine). The command accepts, as its first an only argument, the same set of `IN` and/or `INOUT` parameters (and corresponding values) and returns back a `Task` object which provides the API for task-level actions (check the reference [API docs](ClientAPITypeScript.md#task) for more details).

Starting the task and cancelling it if takes longer than a specified amount of time to finish can be done, in TypeScript, as follows:

```TypeScript
const task = myService.sakila.inventoryInStock.start({ pInventoryId: 1 }, { timeout: 10000 });

for await (const report of task.watch()) {
  if (report.status === "TIMEOUT") {
    await task.kill();
  } else if (report.status === "CANCELLED") {
    // this block is executed after the task is killed
    console.log(report.message);
  }
}
```

Getting the actual result produced by the REST routine can be done as follows:

```TypeScript
const task = myService.sakila.inventoryInStock.start({ pInventoryId: 1 });

for await (const report of task.watch()) {
  if (report.status === "COMPLETED") {
    console.log(report.data); // true
  }
}
```
