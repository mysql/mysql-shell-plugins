# ALTER

## ALTER REST SERVICE

An existing REST service can be altered by using the `ALTER REST SERVICE` statement. It uses the same `restServiceOptions` as used by the [`CREATE REST SERVICE`](#create-rest-service) statement. Please see the discussion of the options [there](#create-rest-service).

**_SYNTAX_**

```antlr
alterRestServiceStatement:
    ALTER REST SERVICE serviceRequestPath (
        NEW REQUEST PATH newServiceRequestPath
    )? restServiceOptions?
;

restServiceOptions: (
        enabledDisabled
        | restAuthentication
        | jsonOptions
        | comments
        | metadata
    )+
;
```

alterRestServiceStatement ::=
![alterRestServiceStatement](../../images/sql/alterRestServiceStatement.svg "alterRestServiceStatement")

restServiceOptions ::=
![restServiceOptions](../../images/sql/restServiceOptions.svg "restServiceOptions")

**_Examples_**

The following example alters a REST service `/myService` by setting a new comment.

```sql
ALTER REST SERVICE /myService
    COMMENTS "A simple, improved REST service";
```

## ALTER REST SCHEMA

An existing REST schema can be altered by using the `ALTER REST SCHEMA` statement. It uses the same `restSchemaOptions` as used by the [`CREATE REST SCHEMA`](#create-rest-schema) statement. Please see the discussion of the options there.

**_SYNTAX_**

```antlr
alterRestSchemaStatement:
    ALTER REST DATABASE schemaRequestPath? (
        ON SERVICE? serviceRequestPath
    )? (
        NEW REQUEST PATH newSchemaRequestPath
    )? (FROM schemaName)? restSchemaOptions?
;

restSchemaOptions: (
        enabledDisabled
        | authenticationRequired
        | itemsPerPage
        | jsonOptions
        | comments
        | metadata
    )+
;
```

alterRestSchemaStatement ::=
![alterRestSchemaStatement](../../images/sql/alterRestSchemaStatement.svg "alterRestSchemaStatement")

restSchemaOptions ::=
![restSchemaOptions](../../images/sql/restSchemaOptions.svg "restSchemaOptions")

**_Examples_**

The following example alters a REST schema `/myService` to use a new request path `/myPublicService`.

```sql
ALTER REST SCHEMA /sakila ON SERVICE /myService
    NEW REQUEST PATH /myPublicService;
```

## ALTER REST VIEW

The `ALTER REST DATA MAPPING VIEW` statement is used to alter existing REST data mapping views.

Please see the corresponding [GraphQL section](#defining-the-graphql-definition-for-a-rest-view) about how to design the GraphQL definition for a REST data mapping view.

Please see the MRS Developer's Guide to learn more about [JSON data mapping views](index.html#rest-views).

**_SYNTAX_**

```antlr
alterRestViewStatement:
    ALTER REST DATA? MAPPING? VIEW
        viewRequestPath (ON serviceSchemaSelector)? (
        NEW REQUEST PATH newViewRequestPath
    )? (
        CLASS restObjectName graphQlCrudOptions? graphQlObj?
    )? restObjectOptions?
;

serviceSchemaSelector:
    (SERVICE serviceRequestPath)? DATABASE schemaRequestPath
;

restObjectOptions: (
        enabledDisabled
        | authenticationRequired
        | itemsPerPage
        | jsonOptions
        | comments
        | metadata
        | restViewMediaType
        | restViewFormat
        | restViewAuthenticationProcedure
    )+
;
```

alterRestViewStatement ::=
![alterRestViewStatement](../../images/sql/alterRestViewStatement.svg "alterRestViewStatement")

serviceSchemaSelector ::=
![serviceSchemaSelector](../../images/sql/serviceSchemaSelector.svg "serviceSchemaSelector")

restObjectOptions ::=
![restObjectOptions](../../images/sql/restObjectOptions.svg "restObjectOptions")

**_Examples_**

The following example alters a REST data mapping view for the `sakila.city` database schema table and sets a new list of fields.

```sql
ALTER REST VIEW /city
ON SERVICE /myService SCHEMA /sakila
FROM `sakila`.`city` AS MyServiceSakilaCity {
    cityId: city_id @SORTABLE,
    city: city
};
```

## ALTER REST PROCEDURE

The `ALTER REST PROCEDURE` statement is used to alter REST endpoints for database schema stored procedures.

It uses the same [extended GraphQL syntax](#defining-the-graphql-definition-for-a-rest-view) as defined for REST data mapping views to describe the REST procedure's parameters and result sets. Please make sure to study the [corresponding section](#defining-the-graphql-definition-for-a-rest-view).

**_SYNTAX_**

```antlr
alterRestProcedureStatement:
    ALTER REST PROCEDURE procedureRequestPath (
        ON serviceSchemaSelector
    )? (
        NEW REQUEST PATH newProcedureRequestPath
    )? (PARAMETERS restObjectName? graphQlObj)? restProcedureResult* restObjectOptions?
;

serviceSchemaSelector:
    (SERVICE serviceRequestPath)? DATABASE schemaRequestPath
;

restObjectOptions: (
        enabledDisabled
        | authenticationRequired
        | itemsPerPage
        | jsonOptions
        | comments
        | metadata
        | restViewMediaType
        | restViewFormat
        | restViewAuthenticationProcedure
    )+
;
```

alterRestProcedureStatement ::=
![alterRestProcedureStatement](../../images/sql/alterRestProcedureStatement.svg "alterRestProcedureStatement")

serviceSchemaSelector ::=
![serviceSchemaSelector](../../images/sql/serviceSchemaSelector.svg "serviceSchemaSelector")

restObjectOptions ::=
![restObjectOptions](../../images/sql/restObjectOptions.svg "restObjectOptions")

## ALTER REST FUNCTION

The `ALTER REST FUNCTION` statement is used to alter REST endpoints for database schema stored functions.

It uses the same [extended GraphQL syntax](#defining-the-graphql-definition-for-a-rest-view) as defined for REST data mapping views to describe the REST procedure's parameters and result sets. Please make sure to study the [corresponding section](#defining-the-graphql-definition-for-a-rest-view).

**_SYNTAX_**

```antlr
alterRestFunctionStatement:
    ALTER_SYMBOL REST_SYMBOL FUNCTION_SYMBOL functionRequestPath (
        ON_SYMBOL serviceSchemaSelector
    )? (
        NEW_SYMBOL REQUEST_SYMBOL PATH_SYMBOL newFunctionRequestPath
    )? (PARAMETERS_SYMBOL restObjectName? graphQlObj)? restFunctionResult* restObjectOptions?
;

serviceSchemaSelector:
    (SERVICE serviceRequestPath)? DATABASE schemaRequestPath
;

restObjectOptions: (
        enabledDisabled
        | authenticationRequired
        | itemsPerPage
        | jsonOptions
        | comments
        | metadata
        | restViewMediaType
        | restViewFormat
        | restViewAuthenticationProcedure
    )+
;
```

alterRestFunctionStatement ::=
![alterRestFunctionStatement](../../images/sql/alterRestFunctionStatement.svg "alterRestFunctionStatement")

serviceSchemaSelector ::=
![serviceSchemaSelector](../../images/sql/serviceSchemaSelector.svg "serviceSchemaSelector")

restObjectOptions ::=
![restObjectOptions](../../images/sql/restObjectOptions.svg "restObjectOptions")
