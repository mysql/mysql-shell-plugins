# Introduction

It has been an essential goal of the MySQL REST Service (MRS) to provide a management interface that feels familiar to MySQL developers and DBAs and integrates well into their existing processes.

For this purpose the MySQL REST Service plugins directly into the [MySQL Shell](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/shell/) and [MySQL Shell for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Oracle.mysql-shell-for-vs-code). It extends the available SQL commands to include DDL (Data Definition Language) statements that allow managing the MySQL REST Service in an easy and seamless way.

This makes the process of creating a MySQL REST Service for your application as easy as creating a database schema or table.

**_Example_**

The following script configures the MySQL REST Service, creates a new REST service `/myService` and adds a REST schema `/sakila` and a REST DUALITY VIEW `/actor` that lists all actors and their film titles.

```sql
CONFIGURE REST METADATA;

CREATE REST SERVICE /myService;
USE REST SERVICE /myService;

CREATE REST SCHEMA /sakila FROM `sakila`;
USE REST SCHEMA /sakila;

CREATE REST DUALITY VIEW /actor
AS `sakila`.`actor` {
    actorId: actor_id @SORTABLE,
    firstName: first_name,
    lastName: last_name,
    lastUpdate: last_update,
    filmActor: sakila.film_actor @REDUCETO(title) {
        film: sakila.film @UNNEST {
            title: title
        }
    }
}
AUTHENTICATION REQUIRED;
```

> Note: Please ensure to install the [MySQL sakila example database schema](https://downloads.mysql.com/docs/sakila-db.zip) before running the MRS DDL script above.
