# Introduction to the MRS SDK

The MySQL REST Service offers a Software Development Kit (SDK) that simplifies the process of writing client applications and interacting with the REST service.

The SDK features a Client API that is specifically generated for each MRS REST Service and therefore offers the best possible support for each REST project.

Currently, support for TypeScript is available. Support for other languages is planned.

## Generation of SDK Files

### On the Fly Generation of TypeScript SDK

The MySQL Shell for VS Code extension allows interactive execution of TypeScript code inside a DB Notebook. To make working with the MySQL REST Service easier, the TypeScript SDK for the current REST Service is made available directly within the DB Notebooks.

Whenever a REST DB Object has being edited the TypeScript SDK is updated to allow instant prototyping of REST queries using the Client API.

This allows for adjusting and fine tuning the REST DB Objects until they exactly meet the developer's requirements and to prototype Client API calls for a development project.

### Generating the SDK files for a Development Project

To generate the SDK files for a development project, right click on the MRS Service and select `Export REST Service SDK Files ...`. This will allow you to select a destination folder inside your development project the files will be placed in.

The following files will be placed in the selected folder.

__TypeScript__

- `MrsBaseClasses.ts` - A file that contains the MRS base classes used by the Client API
- `<RestServiceName>.ts` - The Client API for the specific REST Service using the service's name.
- `config.json` - A configuration file used for the SDK generation

To start using the Client API import the `<RestServiceName>.ts` file in your project.
