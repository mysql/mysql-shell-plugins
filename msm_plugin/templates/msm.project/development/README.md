# Database Schema Development

This folder contains the database schema CREATE script currently under development.

## File Name Format

The database schema development file consists of 3 components.

- The name of the database schema, with spaces replaced by underscores and characters not commonly used in filenames removed.
- The `_next` suffix, which indicates that the next version of the database schema is being developed.
- The .sql file extension

```txt
<schema_name>_next.sql
```

Note that the current development version is not part of the filename. The version information is only added when a release is prepared.
